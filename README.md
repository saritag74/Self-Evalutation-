Sarita Garcia (visualization specialist)

Cohesive written analysis:
	I was in charge of creating visualization on the project and to be able to link it with html. I started off by creating three tables with SQL. The three tables were created with the csv file that was provided by my team member Jacob. The three tables that were created were two tables with unclean data and the last one that  was created was with clean data. 

	In the visualization part  I worked with tableau to create charts and graphs to have a better visual understanding of the clean data chart that I created in SQL.  With the Clean data chart I was able to create two bar charts, bubble charts, and Gantt charts. 

Created the gender breakdown  since the data was only  read female and male by number 1, 0. In gender breakdown I was able to read it to females and male.
Created BMI Bubble Chart it gives us how many participants fall on each category of the BMI breakdown. It gives us a count on how many participants have cardiovascular disease.
In the Blood pressure graph sheet it describes diastolic and systolic blood pressure it shows as well if heart disease is present. In the chart it shows if the participant has heart disease by providing us with 1 and 0. If the participant has heart disease it gives us a 1 and if heart disease is not present it provides us with 0.
In the two bar charts of Blood Pressure by Gender and Lifestyle Factor we can see a breakdown of the average number of the average between men and women who have diastolic and systolic.
 
In the second bar chart we can see that it gives us the type of lifestyles that affect cardiovascular disease by showing us as well the average of the participants that have heart disease, cholesterol, glucose, and show participants that smoke, and consume alcohol.

In the Last gantt chart it shows how age and active lifestyle plays a part in heart disease. Itâ€™s a little like the blood pressure sheet, where the 0 and the 1 shows us If the participant has heart disease or not    




Cohesive written analysis:

	I had a fantastic team! We consistently meet in class and out of class . We Would consistently have zoom calls if we had issues with the work that was distributed between. We contribute with ideas of what show we provide if we miss something. In the beginning with Jacob we just view if maybe he missed some information.Give him ideas on what to remove just in case he missed some.

Manasi was always willing to help. She helped every time she was available.  Sylvia as well was always willing to help. We Would review our work if we missed something we would help one another.

Team Analysis
	The team and I would start meeting before the time started to work on the project. At first we started to talk about a topic that we were interested in but we ended up working on another topic. We try to meet very often to try to gather ideas on what to work on. We address what were our weaknesses and our fortes.  We divided the  work by what we knew better. Jacab with the cleaning the data. He works fast and We work on some part of the data cleaning during class. 
		Manasi was strong on machine learning  and since Sylvia was strong on java script she started focusing on that aspect of the project. That left me with the visualization of the project.  
The team found a way to be able to communicate and stay constante with communication if we encounter any issue. The Power point was a work of constant change  between all of us. 

	We wanted to be able to demostrate the thing behind causing heart disease. A sickness that is becoming very popular, but the thing is that it is a disease that can be prevented. 85% of deaths in 2019 were heart disease. Machine learning helps  predict heart disease at an early stage. Gradient boosting classifier is the one that we aregreed together to use since it gave us the highest result.

In every meeting we had we would address if we agreed with the ideas that we came up with or if any of us would be able to provide any idea to help improve the project.
